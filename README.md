# iTop-SafeTrain
An iTop Extention to affect CIs to SAFe Trains. Trains are defined as Tag.

This permit to affact the same FunctionalCI to serveral Trains.

Adds also a 'Train' class for iTop. This is essentialy a placeholder for customized dashboards

## Ideas

We recently split our DSI into SAFE Trains. But our SI was highly mutualized, and saying that one CI was dedicated to one train is not always possible.

So we started to use a specific tag, and we allowed the same CI to be 'shared' between Trains.

But now, we need to create report dedicated for our Trains. Hence the ideas of a 'Train' Class, with the same information as the Train TAG, but with specific Dashboards.

## Current state

As of November 2023, this extension is a fusion between the former version of iTop-SafeTrain and another work, iTop-SafeTrainClass
